## UX
 
The propose of this website is to introduce the company and the main services they provide. Additionally, the user can contact the firm to hire their services or to get more information.

To take a look at the initial wireframe, you can find it on the 'wireframes' folder on the main directory.

## Features

The website has five main features:
 - The navbar links to each section of the page.
 - A dropdown button bellow the navbar to change the language of the page, Spanish version is yet to be implemented.
 - On the header and footer of the website you can find the links to the social media pages of the company.
 - In the contact section on the bottom you can see an embedded Google Maps with the location of the company office.
 - In the contact section as well you can send a message to get in contact with the firm.
 
### Features Left to Implement
- To get in contact with the company, the form needs to be finished to be fully functional.
- A News section on top of the hero-image. Automated to post news about the advertising and communications market.

## Technologies Used

This website was developed in HTML for markup, and CSS for style after designing the main layout with Bootstrap. 

Additionally, the next technologies were used:

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - I used **Balsamiq Wireframes** to design and test the base layout of this project.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - I used **Bootstrap** to style layout and elements.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
