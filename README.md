## UX
 
The propose of this website is to introduce the company and the main services they provide. Additionally, the user can contact the firm to hire their services or to get more information.

To take a look at the initial wireframe, you can find it on the 'wireframes' folder on the main directory.

## Features

The website has five main features:
 - The navbar links to each section of the page.
 - A dropdown button bellow the navbar to change the language of the page, Spanish version is yet to be implemented.
 - On the header and footer of the website you can find the links to the social media pages of the company.
 - In the contact section on the bottom you can see an embedded Google Maps with the location of the company office.
 - In the contact section as well you can send a message to get in contact with the firm.
 
### Features Left to Implement
- To get in contact with the company, the form needs to be finished to be fully functional.
- A News section on top of the hero-image. Automated to post news about the advertising and communications market.

## Technologies Used

This website was developed in HTML for markup, and CSS for style after designing the main layout with Bootstrap. 

Additionally, the next technologies were used:

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - I used **Balsamiq Wireframes** to design and test the base layout of this project.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - I used **Bootstrap** to style layout and elements.

## Testing

All user testing has been with the hosted website in the GitHub platform. The objective was to test the responsiveness of the site, mainly to check how the different devices adapt to the changes in the layout.

The devices that this site was test were:

- Samsung Galaxy S20
- Samsung Galaxy A50
- Iphone 8 Plus
- Laptop ASUS S510UA, 15.6"
- Laptop OMEN 15, 15.6"
- Desktop PC, 27"
- Tablet was tested with Chrome developer tools.

Tests were made at the beginning project, and aswell with the final version. 

Some changes that were made compared to the initial wireframe after the first tests:

- The navbar was changed to made it a smaller, and the links now take the same row as the brand.
- Contact details, social media links and language selector now go on top of the hero image. 
- A new section was added, 'Why Choose Us', as requested by the client.

## Deployment

This website is hosted in the GitHub Pages platform. 




This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
